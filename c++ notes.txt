C++
Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.
C++ is an object oriented language.
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It supports class and objects.

First version- C++98
Latest version- C++23

new.cpp -> new.i -> new.obj -> compile -> execute 
            |                                |
          intermediate                    new.exe


syntax-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

   return 0;
}

# - hash/pound/ preprocesser directive
# will run before compiler
# used to make intermediate file.

include- It is a folder.
and iostream is its header file
this file include -cout<<, cin>>

{ cout<<,cin>> are the functions of iostream ,iostream  is the header file of include,
and include is the folder, and to convert this folder into bit we use #.}

using - Its keyword
namespace - it is use for nameconflict
std- header file 
;-terminal
{ we use this line to use same thing without repeating it or with out rewriting. like we do not need to write std again again. }

int main{} - from this line compiler use to read the code,.

return 0;-  code execute successfully 
            after this compiler do not read code except some cases

Tokens -  A smallest and individual unit of program is called as tokens
keywords-         Predefines words  main, int, include
identifier-       variable name , function name , class name 
Puncuators or separator  -       special symbol
Constant-         not going to change like ( pi ki value  )
Operator-        (,),@,#,!,+ %
String-          Sequence of character

variable
Its use to store data (in deep jab variable create kerte hai toh  vo  memoryme jake store hota hai with address)
variable like int a=10  
variable always start with _ and alphabet , 
variable can not be keyword, special symbol , numerical value.

Data type 
1.int (integer)- 12,-23,42

int a =10;
int a ; //declare
a= 10; //intialize
2. float -  1.23 ,1.54, (takes 7to 8 values after decimal)
3. double- 1.678766434,6.8764545 (takes 10-14 values after decimal)
4. char(character) - '2','a''$' 
5. bool (Boolean) - true(1) &false (0)

Questions

// Q1. What will be the output of this code?
{
   int a = 7, b = 2;
int result = a / b;
cout << result;
 
}

// Q 2. What happens if you store a decimal number in an int variable?
{
  int x = 7.8;
cout << x;
  
}

// 3. Predict the output and explain: 
{
int a = 2147483647; // Max value for 32-bit int
a = a + 1;
cout << a;
}

// Q4. Write a simple code to find if a number is even or odd using int.
{
int num = 9;
if (num % 2 == 0)
    cout << "Even";
else
    cout << "Odd";
}

Address ,Size Limit of datatypes-
Address-> variable   we use &-> ampersent or address of
like -  int a=10;
        cout<<&a<<endl;

Size--> datatype
like- cout<<sizeof(int)<<endl;
      cout<<sizeof(float)<<endl;
      cout<<sizeof(double)<<endl;
      cout<<sizeof(char)<<endl;
      cout<<sizeof(bool)<<endl;

//limit-> datatype ( for this we should first include <limits> in header file )
like- cout<<numeric_limits<int>::max()<<endl;
      cout<<numeric_limits<int>::min()<<endl;
    
      cout<<numeric_limits<float>::max()<<endl;
      cout<<numeric_limits<float>::min()<<endl;
    
      cout<<numeric_limits<bool>::max()<<endl;
      cout<<numeric_limits<bool>::min()<<endl;

//climits - we use this for mostly char as limit do not works for char properly .
like -    cout<<INT_MAX<<endl;
          cout<<INT_MIN<<endl;

          cout<<CHAR_MAX<<endl;
          cout<<CHAR_MIN<<endl;

   cout<<a<<endl;

}
relational <,>,>=,<=,==,!= its use in conditional statements

using namespace std;
//Relational  operator
int main()

   int b=20;
   cout<<(a<b)<<endl;    //less than
   cout<<(a>b)<<endl;   //greater than 
   cout<<(a<=b)<<endl;    //less than or eual too

   cout<<(a==b)<<endl;     //equal too
    cout<<(a!=b)<<endl;   //!= not equal too
}
logical   && ,||,!
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//Logical  operator

 except 0 all values are true even negative values also 
int main()
 {
    cout<<(1&&0)<<endl;
    cout<<(1&&1)<<endl;
    cout<<(21&&77)<<endl;
    cout<<(1||0)<<endl;
    cout<<(!60)<<endl;

Bitwise 
Ternary if else ke Pehle padhenge abhi nhi
17:00 11-07-2025
Binary - arthemetic , logical , assignment, bitwise,relational
Ternary - 
Unary ---------
prefix - pre increment ++a 
ex- int a=10;
cout<<(++a);            o/p-11

         pre decrement --a
ex- int a=10;
cout<<(--a);             o/p - 9

Postfix -post increment a++
ex- int a=10;
cout<<(a++);            o/p-10
cout<<a;                o/p-11

         post decrement a--
ex- int a=10;
cout<<(a--);           o/p- 10
cout<<a;               o/p- 9

 by other sir


what is variable - it refer the memoryaddress  of datatype.

datatype is different type of data is stored in data.
Tokens -  A smallest and individual unit of program is called as tokens.

keywords-         Predefines words  main, int, include


identifier-      variable name , function name , class name 


Puncuators or separator  -       special symbol like ; , /n,/t,{,}


Constant-         not going to change like ( pi ki value  )


Operator-        (,),@,#,!,+ %


String-         Its datatype , Sequence of character

Q 6 Check the number is between 0-50?
{
    int num;
    cout<<"Enter a number ";
    cin>>num;
    (num<=50)?cout<<"Between":cout<<"Not between";          

}

 Q 7 Check the year is leap year or not?
if the year is divisible by 4 then its a leap year.
and if the year is divisible by both 4 and 100 then its not a leap year
But the year is divisible by 4,100 and 400 then it is leap year

{
    int year;
    cout << "Enter a year: ";
    cin >> year;
    ((year % 400 == 0 && year % 4==0  && year % 100==0) || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)) ?
        cout << year << " is a Leap Year." : cout << year << " is NOT a Leap Year.";
}

{
    char character;
    cout<<"Enter a character" ;
    cin>>character;
    (character == 'a' || character == 'e' || character =='i' ||character == 'o' || character =='u' || character == 'A' || character == 'E' || character =='I' ||character == 'O' || character =='U'
)?cout<<"Vowel":cout<<"Constant";

 As in this code we have to apply multiple conditions and it may give error, so toh resolve this we use conditional statements.
Conditional statements-
IF
IF ELSE
IF ELSE IF ELSE (LADDER)
IS IS ELSE(NESTED IF)

IF ----
if(condition){}
--
 int num;
    cout<<"Enter a number";
    cin>>num;
int a=10;
if(a%2==0){
cout<<"Even";}


ternary ke sare questions if else me kerna hai

IFELSE----
 int num;
    cout<<"Enter a number";
    cin>>num;
if(a%2==0){
cout<<"Even";}
else{
cout<<"Odd";}
