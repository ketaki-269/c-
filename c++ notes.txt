C++
Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.
C++ is an object oriented language.
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It supports class and objects.

First version- C++98
Latest version- C++23

new.cpp -> new.i -> new.obj -> compile -> execute 
            |                                |
          intermediate                    new.exe


syntax-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

   return 0;
}

# - hash/pound/ preprocesser directive
# will run before compiler
# used to make intermediate file.

include- It is a folder.
and iostream is its header file
this file include -cout<<, cin>>

{ cout<<,cin>> are the functions of iostream ,iostream  is the header file of include,
and include is the folder, and to convert this folder into bit we use #.}

using - Its keyword
namespace - it is use for nameconflict
std- header file 
;-terminal
{ we use this line to use same thing without repeating it or with out rewriting. like we do not need to write std again again. }

int main{} - from this line compiler use to read the code,.

return 0;-  code execute successfully 
            after this compiler do not read code except some cases
